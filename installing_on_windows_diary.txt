Ok keeping track of what I do to get puzzlescript building on windows. (I haven't done this in a while from scratch, it might be out of date)

1 - sync to github repo
2 - try opening the folder in vs code
3 - realize that the build scripts rely on the folder being called src and there being a parallel bin directory
*4 - move everything to a src directory in the github structure (probably breaking things on mac)
*5 - edited the ..gitignore file to take this into account
6 - try to run the non-compiled version (src/editor.html). Oh I can just run it in edge. Also chrome. Also firefox. (Much easier than on mac, where you need a http server).
7 - install packages
> npm install
