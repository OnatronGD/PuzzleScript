About this fork
============

This fork is primarily meant for use in my PuzzleScript projects. Feel free to use it yourself, but for now it'll be tailored to my needs and I may make breaking changes.

See https://github.com/OnatronGD/PuzzleScript/wiki for a list of features I've added and plan to add.
